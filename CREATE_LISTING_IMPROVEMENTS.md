- [ ] Cannot proceed from Step 3 without uploading at least 1 image
- [ ] Cannot submit form without at least one contact method
- [ ] Cannot submit form without images (even if bypassing Step 3)

### Image Carousel:
- [ ] Upload 1 image - should display in carousel
- [ ] Upload multiple images (2-5) - should all appear
- [ ] Click left/right arrows - images should change
- [ ] Click thumbnails - should jump to that image
- [ ] Delete an image - carousel should adjust correctly
- [ ] Delete all images - carousel should disappear, upload button reappears

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Try to proceed to Step 4 without images - should be blocked
- [ ] Try to submit with images but no contact - should be blocked
