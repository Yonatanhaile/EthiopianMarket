# Listing Detail Image Carousel Fix

## Date: October 8, 2025

## Issue
When users clicked on a listing from the home page, the listing detail page only showed the first image, even if the seller had uploaded multiple images (up to 5).

## Solution
Implemented a full image carousel on the listing detail page, similar to the one on the create listing page.

## Changes Made

### File: `EthiopiaMarket/src/pages/ListingDetail.jsx`

#### Added:
1. **State Management**
   - `currentImageIndex` state to track which image is being displayed

2. **Navigation Functions**
   - `nextImage()` - Navigate to the next image
   - `prevImage()` - Navigate to the previous image
   - Both functions wrap around (circular navigation)

3. **UI Components**
   - **Main Image Display**: Shows one image at a time in large format with `object-contain`
   - **Left/Right Navigation Arrows**: 
     - Only visible when there are 2+ images
     - Large, semi-transparent circular buttons
     - Positioned on the sides of the main image
   - **Image Counter**: 
     - Shows "X / Y" format (e.g., "2 / 5")
     - Only visible when there are 2+ images
     - Positioned at the bottom center
   - **Thumbnail Navigation Strip**:
     - Shows all images as clickable thumbnails
     - Currently selected image has blue border and ring
     - Horizontally scrollable if many images
     - Only visible when there are 2+ images

## Features

### For Single Image Listings
- Displays the single image in a clean layout
- No navigation arrows or counter (not needed)
- Simple, distraction-free viewing experience

### For Multiple Image Listings
- **Carousel Navigation**: Click left/right arrows to browse
- **Thumbnail Quick Jump**: Click any thumbnail to jump to that image
- **Visual Feedback**: Active thumbnail is highlighted with blue border
- **Image Counter**: Always know which image you're viewing
- **Smooth Transitions**: Images change instantly when navigating
- **Keyboard-Friendly**: Arrows have proper ARIA labels

## User Experience

### Before:
```
Home Page → Click Listing → See only 1st image ❌
```

### After:
```
Home Page → Click Listing → See all images with carousel ✅
- Use arrows to swipe through images
- Click thumbnails to jump to specific images
- See counter showing "2 / 5" etc.
```

## Technical Details

### Image Display Logic:
```javascript
// Show the current image from the array
listing.images[currentImageIndex]

// Navigation wraps around
nextImage: (index + 1) % totalImages
prevImage: (index - 1 + totalImages) % totalImages
```

### Responsive Design:
- **Main Image**: `aspect-video` ratio (16:9)
- **Thumbnails**: 80x80px, scrollable horizontally
- **Arrow Buttons**: 48x48px, touch-friendly
- **Works on**: Desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Performance:
- Only loads images that exist
- Uses `LazyImage` component for optimized loading
- Respects low data mode setting
- Smooth state updates with React hooks

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Create a listing with multiple images** (2-5 images)
2. **Go to home page** and click on that listing
3. **Verify**:
   - [ ] All images are accessible
   - [ ] Left/right arrows work
   - [ ] Clicking thumbnails jumps to that image
   - [ ] Image counter updates correctly
   - [ ] Active thumbnail is highlighted
   - [ ] For single-image listings, no arrows/thumbnails shown

- Main image uses `LazyImage` component for optimization
- No breaking changes - backward compatible with existing listings
- Works with both URL format and string format for images
